# **App Name**: ResilientChain

## Core Features:

- Interactive Map: Display an interactive map with color-coded nodes representing supply chain locations (cities, ports, warehouses).
- Node Details: Allow users to click on nodes to view detailed information such as location name and risk level.
- Disruption Scenarios: Implement a dropdown menu to trigger predefined disruption scenarios (e.g., Port Strike, Truck Breakdown).
- Real-time KPI Updates: Update KPI cards (Cost Impact, Delay Impact, Carbon Impact) in real-time when a disruption scenario is triggered.
- AI Scenario Tool: Simulate scenario analysis with the ability for users to ask natural language questions, then return the simulation to the user.
- Risk Radar: Provide a summary screen showing risks to your current supply chain based on scenario simulations. Provide a high-level view to focus the users attention.
- Route Visualization: Show routes connecting the various supply chain locations on the map, visually representing the flow of goods. Consider a glowing effect that flows over time along the paths.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#121212) to provide a modern dark mode aesthetic and reduce eye strain.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements, nodes, and primary actions.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) for highlights and key indicators to draw attention to critical information.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for both headlines and body text to maintain a clean and modern user interface.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons in white or light gray for high readability against the dark background.
- Implement a sidebar for primary navigation and a top bar for global actions, maximizing screen real estate for the map and AI assistant.
- Use subtle transitions and animations when switching views or triggering scenarios to provide a smooth user experience.
